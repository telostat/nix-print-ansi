# Nix Wrapper for `ansi` Script

This is a Nix wrapper for [ansi](https://github.com/fidian/ansi)
script that:

> [...] will generate the proper ANSI escape sequences to move the
> cursor around the screen, make text bold, add colors and do much
> more. It is designed to help you colorize words and bits of text.

It may be useful for users to pull it in their Nix shells and
fancy-print more conveniently.
